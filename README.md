## ‚öôÔ∏è What I‚Äôll Do Next
1. Scaffold a working frontend (frontend/)
2. Connect Axios to backend http://localhost:5000/api
3. Add some sample pages & UI (login, dashboard, add expense)
4. Ensure full local development works via:

```bash
// For Backend
cd backend
npm install

// For Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
